- 👋 Hi, I’m @PaulMainwood
- 👀 I’m interested in Julia projects, state-space modelling of tricky time-series, and how to incorporate machine learning into those methods, approaches to paired comparisons and also causal sets.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Julia, working to let go of Python and R.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of the above - please let me know if you're working on something interesting.
- 📫 How to reach me: on here.
